"Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ application to show a pre-launch page and collect emails. Includes an admin view and CSV export. Partially inspired by "beta-signup":https://github.com/steveodom/beta-signup.

h2. Set up

# @bundle install@
# Create @config.yml@ and @database.yml@ from the example files
# Create your database
# Run @rake db:migrate@

Now you're ready to:

<pre><code>rackup</code></pre>

And open "localhost:9292":http://localhost:9292.

Although to hack on the app, we recommend using "shotgun":https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun/ as a local server, as it will automatically reload code changes.

h2. How to contribute

# Clone your fork of https://github.com/renderedtext/coming-soon
# Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
# Hack away
# Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running @bundle exec cucumber@
# If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
# Push the branch up to GitHub
# Send a pull request for your branch
